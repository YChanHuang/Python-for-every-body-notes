# Mistakes
 I made a few mistakes:
 1. I did not store the extracted data into a list
 2. I swapped the positions of key, value


### Mistake (Data is not store in a list)
The corrected codes as followed.
```
di = {}
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From '): #I forgot the space while the first trial
        line = line.rstrip()
        words = line.split()
        email = list()
        # it should use list to store the email otherwise the loop would treat extracted data as a massive string
        email.append(words[1])
        for em in email:
            di[em] = di.get(em, 0) + 1
        # print(di)
```
### Mistake (For loop)
 for **v,k** in di.items():

The correct version of mulitiple for-loop should be followed.
```
for k,v in di.items():
    if v > largest :
        largest = v
        prolific_em = k
print(prolific_em, largest)
```
